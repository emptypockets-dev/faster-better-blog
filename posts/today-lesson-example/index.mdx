### ðŸŽ’ backpack (closure)

```js
const anyFunction = () => {
  let backpackItem = { data: 1 };
  // everything here goes in the "backpack" 
  return () => {
    console.log((backpackItem.data += 1));
    // the scope of anyFunction is kept
    // in the backpack when called
  };
};

const newFunction = anyFunction(); // assigned to the code that
                                   // anyfunction returns and wears
                                   // a "backpack" of the scope 
                                   // where it was called
newFunction(); // 2 // highlight-line
newFunction(); // 3 // highlight-line
// newFunction still has access to "backpack" 
// when it is called!
// a "backpack" of scope data gets saved into memory
// on a nested object connected to the function
```
