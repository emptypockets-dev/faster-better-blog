import concept from "./concept.jpeg"
import conceptThumb from "./concept-thumb.jpeg"
import Img from "/src/components/Img"

## Concept

Use strips of color to represent the technologies mentioned in each post. In the first version, the colors and technologies can be manually entered. 

Can I pull the colors based on mentions in the post? 

<Img src={conceptThumb} alt="concept"/>

It definitely makes sense to build this in React. 

### Open questions
1. should I generate an SVG? 
2. does it need to animate?


### Steps to think about

1. make a list of each technology
2. assign a color for each
3. mockup an image in various scenarios
4. create a regular html/css element 
5. convert it into a React component
6. ???
