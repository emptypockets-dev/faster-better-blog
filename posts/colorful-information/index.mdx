import concept from "./concept.jpeg"
import conceptThumb from "./concept-thumb.jpeg"
import Img from "/src/components/Img"

## Concept

Use strips of color to represent the technologies mentioned in each post. In the first version, the colors and technologies can be manually entered. 

Can I pull the colors based on mentions in the post? 

<Img src={conceptThumb} alt="concept"/>

It definitely makes sense to build this in React. 

In coding...
