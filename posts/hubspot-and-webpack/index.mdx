<p>
  If you just want to copy a minimal webpack.config.js file skip to the{" "}
  <a href='https://github.com/emptypockets-dev/hubspot-with-webpack'>
    Github repo
  </a>
  .
</p>

<h2>Part One</h2>
<h3>Just the basics</h3>
<p>
  The rest of this post assumes you are comfortable working with Hubspot and
  probably use npm all the time. Make sure you have the latest version of the
  Hubspot CLI installed.
</p>

```
npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest
```

-

<h3>Just the boilerplate</h3>
<p>
  Use the Hubspot CLI to create a new website theme in a local folder. Switch to
  the
  <a href='https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate'>
    &nbsp;Hubspot docs
  </a> if you get stuck at this point.
</p>

```
mkdir hubspot && cd hubspot
hs create website-theme src/<cool-project-name>
```

<p>
  Run "hs init" to create a "hubspot.config.yml file" and connect your portal
  (almost definitely a separate sandbox or development portal that you already
  setup <a href='https://offers.hubspot.com/free-cms-developer-sandbox'>here</a>
  ). Follow the written instructions (copy + paste your key when prompted).
</p>

```
    hs init
```

<p>
  While you're at it, you'll eventually need a package.json fileâ€”now is a good
  time to create one:
</p>

```
    npm init
```

<p>Initializing a git repo is always a good idea too.</p>

```
    git init
```

-

<h3>Just the dependencies</h3>

```js
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli copy-webpack-plugin @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins
```

<ul class='parts-list'>
  <li>[x] webpack</li>
  <li>[x] webpack-cli</li>
  <li>[x] copy-webpack-plugin</li>
  <li>[x] @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins</li>
</ul>

-

<h3>Just a webpack config file</h3>
<p>
  Create a file name webpack.config.js in your root directory. Copy pasta the
  code below.
</p>

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require("@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "js/main.js",
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      account,
      autoupload,
      src: "dist",
      dest: "<your-project-folder-in-hubspot-here>",
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "src/theme.json", to: "theme.json" },
        { from: "src/fields.json", to: "fields.json" },
        { from: "src/css", to: "css" },
        { from: "src/images", to: "images" },
        { from: "src/modules", to: "modules" },
        { from: "src/templates", to: "templates" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

<p>You can do a lot more with webpack but this is just a start.</p>

-

<h3>Just a start</h3>
<p>
  Add a "start" script in package.json so that you don't have to keep typing
  webpack --watch --mode etc etc etc.
</p>

```
 "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack --watch --mode development --env account 123 --env autoupload",
    }
```

```
npm start
```

<p>
  Next, a series of amazing things happen. The following might be too much
  information at the moment but understanding each step really helps make
  webpack easy to work with.
</p>

<ul class='parts-list'>
  <li>
    <b>1.</b> Values for "account" and "autoupload" are passed to
    webpack.config.js.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>2.</b> Webpack starts to build its dependency graph starting from
    ./src/index.js
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>3.</b> Webpack creates a folder named /dist (by default) and outputs code
    into /dist/js/main.js.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>4.</b> Webpack plugins start to run from the bottom up (in reverse).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>5.</b> CopyWebpackPlugin copies all /src files into the /dist folder
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>6.</b> HubspotAutouploadPlugin syncs each file that moves through webpack
    into the Hubspot destination folder that you set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>7.</b> Webpack watches for changes. It loops through steps 2 through 6
    each time a file is saved.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part Two</h2>
<p>
  In part 2, we're going to add Babel to transpile cutting-edge Javascript into
  boring Javascript that browsers understand.
</p>

<h3>Just lint</h3>
