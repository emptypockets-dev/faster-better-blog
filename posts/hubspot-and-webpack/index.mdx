If you want to skip all the fun, here's all of the code for part 1

```
https://github.com/emptypockets-dev/hubspot-with-webpack
```

The goal for part 1 is to upgrade the standard Hubspot boilerplate to include the Hubspot Autoupload plugin (to automagically sync a sandbox site) and setup the latest version of Webpack to internet better in the future.

<h2>Get all the required Hubspot stuff ready</h2>
<p>
  At the moment, I'll assume that you are familiar with Hubspot. You will need
  Node.js, the Hubspot CLI installed globally and have already setup a developer
  account.
</p>

<h2>Just the boilerplate</h2>
<p>
  Use the Hubspot CLI to create a new project and configure it for local
  development. Hubspot has pretty great explanations for these steps. Generally,
  you want to run these commands in terminalâ€”inside of your project folder
</p>

```
    hs create website-theme <the-name-of-your-new-project>
```

<p>
  Then configure the project by running `hs init` in Terminal and copying your
  key.
</p>

<p>
  Note: don't fetch an existing project. We're going to upload our new local
  project to Hubspot.
</p>

<h2>Install dependencies</h2>

```js
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli copy-webpack-plugin @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins babel-loader
```

<h2>Create a webpack config file</h2>
<p>
  Modify webpack.config.js to support the latest version of Webpack + updated
  plugins
</p>

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require("@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload = true }) => ({
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "js/main.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: "babel-loader",
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      autoupload,
      account,
      src: "dist",
      dest: "theme-with-webpack",
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "src/css", to: "css" },
        { from: "src/images", to: "images" },
        { from: "src/modules", to: "modules" },
        { from: "src/templates", to: "templates" },
        { from: "src/theme.json", to: "theme.json" },
        { from: "src/fields.json", to: "fields.json" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```
