  If you just want to copy a minimal webpack.config.js file skip to the{" "}
  <a href='https://github.com/emptypockets-dev/hubspot-with-webpack'>
    Github repo
  </a>
  .
</p>

<h2>Part One</h2>
<h3>Just the basics</h3>
<p>
  The rest of this post assumes you are comfortable working with Hubspot and
  probably use npm all the time. Make sure you have the latest version of the
  Hubspot CLI installed.
</p>

```
npm install -g @hubspot/cli@latest
```

-

<h3>Just the boilerplate</h3>
<p>
  Use the Hubspot CLI to create a new website theme in a local folder. Switch to
  the
  <a href='https://github.com/HubSpot/cms-theme-boilerplate'>
    &nbsp;Hubspot docs
  </a> if you get stuck at this point.
</p>

```
mkdir hubspot && cd hubspot
hs create website-theme src/<cool-project-name>
```

<p>
  Run "hs init" to create a "hubspot.config.yml file" and connect your portal
  (almost definitely a separate sandbox or development portal that you already
  setup <a href='https://offers.hubspot.com/free-cms-developer-sandbox'>here</a>
  ). Follow the written instructions (copy + paste your key when prompted).
</p>

```
    hs init
```

<p>
  While you're at it, you'll eventually need a package.json file—now is a good
  time to create one:
</p>

```
    npm init
```

<p>Initializing a git repo is always a good idea too.</p>

```
    git init
```

-

<h3>Just the dependencies</h3>

```js
npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli copy-webpack-plugin @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins
```

<ul class='parts-list'>
  <li>☑️ webpack</li>
  <li>☑️ webpack-cli</li>
  <li>☑️ copy-webpack-plugin</li>
  <li>☑️ @hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins</li>
</ul>

-

<h3>Just a webpack config file</h3>
<p>
  Create a file name webpack.config.js in your root directory. Copy pasta the
  code below.
</p>

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require("@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "js/main.js",
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      account,
      autoupload,
      src: "dist",
      dest: "<your-project-folder-in-hubspot-here>",
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "src/theme.json", to: "theme.json" },
        { from: "src/fields.json", to: "fields.json" },
        { from: "src/css", to: "css" },
        { from: "src/images", to: "images" },
        { from: "src/modules", to: "modules" },
        { from: "src/templates", to: "templates" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

<p>You can do a lot more with webpack but this is just a start.</p>

-

<h3>Just a start</h3>
<p>
  Add a "start" script in package.json so that you don't have to keep typing
  webpack --watch --mode etc etc etc.
</p>

```
 "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack --watch --mode development --env account 123 --env autoupload",
    }
```

```
npm start
```

<p>
  Next, a series of amazing things happen. The following might be too much
  information at the moment but understanding each step really helps make
  webpack easy to work with.
</p>

<ul class='parts-list'>
  <li>
    <b>1.</b> Values for "account" and "autoupload" are passed to
    webpack.config.js.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>2.</b> Webpack starts to build its dependency graph starting from
    /src/index.js
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>3.</b> Webpack creates a folder named /dist (by default) and outputs code
    into /dist/js/main.js.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>4.</b> Webpack plugins start to run from the bottom up (in reverse).
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>5.</b> CopyWebpackPlugin copies all /src files into the /dist folder
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>6.</b> HubspotAutouploadPlugin syncs each file that moves through webpack
    into the Hubspot destination folder that you set.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>7.</b> Webpack watches for changes. It loops through steps 2 through 6
    each time a file is saved.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Part Two</h2>
<h3>Before you begin</h3>
<p>
  I'm still working on a good SCSS solution that allows for HubL variables and
  theme setup. Whatever that solution ends up being, the following is a good
  general setup for transpiling SCSS to CSS.
</p>
<p>This solution assumes your SCSS exists in "/src/scss/main.scss".</p>
<p>
  As you'll see, some of the options exist just to be 100% sure that the setup
  is working. First confirm that it works and then start to add more custom
  options
</p>

<h3>Dependencies</h3>

```
npm install --save-dev autoprefixer  css-loader mini-css-extract-plugin node-sass postcss-loader sass-loader
```

<ul class='parts-list'>
  <li>☑️ css-loader</li>
  <li>☑️ mini-css-extract-plugin</li>
  <li>☑️ node-sass</li>
  <li>☑️ postcss-loader</li>
  <li>☑️ sass-loader</li>
</ul>

<h3>Vendor prefixes</h3>
<p>Update your package.json file to include:</p>

```
 "browserslist": [
        "defaults",
        "last 10 version"
    ]
```

<p>
  The browsers you should include depends on your needs. "last 10 version"
  exists so that you can compare your SCSS file and generated CSS file to make
  sure everything is setup correctly.
</p>

<h3>Webpack config</h3>
<p>
  Add MiniCSSExtraPlugin and module: {} to your webpack setup. Remove the CSS
  path from CopyWebpackPlugin. Here's the whole webpack.config.js updated with
  what you'll need:
</p>

```js
const HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin = require("@hubspot/webpack-cms-plugins/HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin");
const CopyWebpackPlugin = require("copy-webpack-plugin");
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");

module.exports = ({ account, autoupload }) => ({
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "js/main.js",
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
          { loader: "css-loader", options: { url: false } },
          {
            loader: "postcss-loader",
            options: {
              postcssOptions: {
                plugins: [
                  [
                    "autoprefixer",
                    {
                      // Options
                    },
                  ],
                ],
              },
            },
          },
          "sass-loader",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
  plugins: [
    new HubSpotAutoUploadPlugin({
      account,
      autoupload,
      src: "dist",
      dest: "theme-with-webpack",
    }),
    new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
      filename: "css/[name].css",
    }),
    new CopyWebpackPlugin({
      patterns: [
        { from: "src/images", to: "images" },
        { from: "src/modules", to: "modules" },
        { from: "src/templates", to: "templates" },
        { from: "src/theme.json", to: "theme.json" },
        { from: "src/fields.json", to: "fields.json" },
      ],
    }),
  ],
});
```

<p>
  Import your scss file in /src/index.js. Remember, this is how Webpack knows
  which files your website depends on (Webpack looks at index.js first).
</p>

```
import './scss/main.scss'
```

-

<h2>Part 2.1</h2>
<h3>Just remember Hubspot compiles code too</h3>

<p>
  If you minimize your CSS code before syncing it with Hubspot then you might
  run into this hard to discover bug. Take a look at this example:
</p>

```
@media (min-width:768px){#global-partial-header nav .about-link{display:block;position:relative;left:-2.4rem;top:-2px}}
```

<p>
  The bug: If the first selector in a media query uses an #id, Hubspot thinks it
  is the first part of a comment. Everything after that line is now commented
  out.
</p>

<p>The solution is to wrap your css output in a HubL raw wrapper</p>

```
npm install --save-dev wrapper-webpack-plugin
```

```js
in webpack.config.js
 plugins: [
        ...other plugins
        new WrapperPlugin({
            test: /\.css$/,
            header: '{% raw %} \n',
            footer: '{% endraw %}',
        }),
       ...other plugins
    ],
```
